# Plot Differential Gene Expression using Shiny
I'm thrilled to share my experience with you as I undertook this engaging guided project offered by Coursera where I've dived into the world of gene expression analysis, leveraging the power of Shiny to create interactive and insightful visualizations. 

In the hands-on project, I delved into the captivating realm of gene expression analysis. I had the privilege of working with real-time PCR data sourced from a published research article titled "An Unbiased Systems Genetics Approach to Mapping Genetic Loci Modulating Susceptibility to Severe Streptococcal Sepsis" by Abdeltawab, N.F. et al. (2008). 

In essence, Abdeltawab et al. conducted a study on the differential host response to sepsis using BXD mice strains. These strains exhibited varying responses to sepsis, from susceptibility to resilience. My project focused on visualizing differentially expressed genes from this research, utilizing Shiny's capabilities to create meaningful plots.

The plots represent genes selected by Abdeltawab et al. from their mapped QTLs that were differentially expressed in susceptible and resistant groups. This is shown as either up or down-regulated in either group or one of the groups. For ease of visualization, I transformed expression values to Log10 in the plots. Part of the data can be examined in the following table.

As I conclude my journey, I am thrilled to have acquired the skills to navigate the realm of gene expression analysis and to harness Shiny's potential for interactive data visualization. Join me as I present my project and share the insights gained along the way.
